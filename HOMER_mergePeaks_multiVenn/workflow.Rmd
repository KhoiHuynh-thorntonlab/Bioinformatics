This workflow will find .bed files containing previously called peaks for each sample, merge peaks from the same treatment group together, then overlap peaks from each histone mark used in the ChIP-Seq experiment with each other and with TSS regions selected from the Gencode database to find the peaks in common and unique for each set. The number of peaks in each category will then be visualized in R by plotting Venn Diagrams.
