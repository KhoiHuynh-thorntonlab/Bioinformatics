Run these commands in the (bash) terminal to submit qsub jobs for FastQC.

```{,engine='bash'}
# directory for the analysis project
ProjDir="/ifs/home/kellys04/projects/SmithLab_HITS-CLIP_2016-03-14"
# cd "$ProjDir"

# directory containing the fastq files
FastqDir="$ProjDir/run_data"

# directory to put the output
FastQC_outdir="$ProjDir/fastqc"

# the FastQC script to be submitted to qsub
FastQCscript="./fastqc_qsub.sh"

# make sure the script is executable
chmod +x "$FastQCscript"

# submit each fastq.gz file to the FastQC script with qsub
for file in $FastqDir/*.fastq.gz; do
  echo "Submitting FastQC job for $file"
  
  # make a subdir for each file
  tmp_outdir="$FastQC_outdir/$(basename $file)"
  mkdir -p "$tmp_outdir"
  echo "Outdir is $tmp_outdir"
  
  # submit the job
  qsub -q all.q -wd $tmp_outdir -o :${tmp_outdir}/ -e :${tmp_outdir}/ -pe threaded 4 "$FastQCscript" "${tmp_outdir}" "${file}"
  # -q <node name prefix>; -wd working dir for the script; -o/e where to put the logs; -pe threaded <n> how many threads to reserve
done
```

(Its easier to have these commands available for easy editing & viewing than saving them as their own script).
