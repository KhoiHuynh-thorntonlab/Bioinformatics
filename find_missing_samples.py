This script will check the output directory of the analysis pipeline to make sure
all the samples listed in the sample sheet are present in the output.

For every sample in the samplesheet, there should be a corresponding directory
in the results dir which has no subdirectories, and has the same name as a sample ID

This script will find the sampleIDs that do not have a corresponding results subdir
